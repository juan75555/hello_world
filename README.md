# hello_world

Hello world, this is my first time on github.
I actually am studying on the University of Oviedo a grade of Computer Engineering at the EPI in Gij√≥n,Asturias,Spain.
This is my first time seriously coding so:

public class hello_world {

	    public static void main(String[] args) {
         System.out.print("Hello World :) ");
    }
  }
